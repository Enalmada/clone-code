# clone-code

A means of turning your source code into template. 
Why?  Because all existing solutions (that I could find with reasonable search time)
require you to copy your code into separate files.  I find this impractical for a rapidly growing and evolving code base.
I just can't justify making every modification twice so I propose this as a potential solution.

## Getting Started
Read the documentation [website](https://clone-code.vercel.app/)

### TODO
- [ ] support copying parts of existing code

### inspiration
* [hygen](https://www.hygen.io/)
* [plop](https://plopjs.com/)

## Contribute
Using [changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) so please remember to run "changeset" with any PR that might be interesting to people on an older template.
Although this isn't being deployed as a module, I would like to call out things worth keeping in sync.
